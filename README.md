This generates the [Ruby-Starter-Kits/Docker-Bridgetown-Template](https://github.com/Ruby-Starter-Kits/Docker-Bridgetown-Template) template repository. It's the latest version of [Bridgetown](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/), with all the files required to run via Docker.

The aim of this project is to allow people who don't have Ruby installed on their system (or prefer using Docker) try Bridgetown, along with giving a sample of how it can be setup for Docker.
